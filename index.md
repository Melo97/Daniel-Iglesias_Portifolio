<div style="text-align: justify"> This project was develop to dynamically clusterize customers to an E-commerce database, based on Frequency and Amount of Money Spent, to better tailor marketing resource allocation. It was used KMeans to define the customers importance, and mySQL to create and maintin (UPDATE) the database. </div>

## Sentiment Analysis for Skincare Product Reviews
  
### **Skills:** NLP, VADER, BERT, DataViz, Pandas

[![Open Notebook](https://img.shields.io/badge/Jupyter-Open_Notebook-blue?logo=Jupyter)](Projects/Sentiment-Analysis.html)

<div style="text-align: justify"> By using two different algorithms, VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) and BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), this notebook was able to predict client sentiments over a product by its review. This application can be a useful for in e-commerce channels, where it has hundreds or thousands reviews, and automatically analyze customer feedbacks and better tailor responses accordingly. </div>

[![View on GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-View_on_GitHub-blue?logo=GitHub)](https://github.com/Melo97/Brest-Cancer-Type-Classification)

<div style="text-align: justify"> This Machine Learning model was build with the objective to better predict if a Brest Cancer is either Benign or Malignant. To train and test the model, it was used the 'Breast Cancer Wisconsin Database', and built with PCA decomposition and the SVM classifier -predict Cancer class (1: Malignant | 0: Benign). </div>
